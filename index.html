    <h1>Visit Hollandstoun Island!</h1>
    <p> Hollandstoun Island, in the islands of Orkney north of Scotland, is a beautiful location to visit year round. In the summer our winds are bracing and there are many historical sites to visit. In the winter visitors can enjoy the authentic islander experience including Arctic daylight hours, sea storms and unique breeds of sheep.</p>
    <p>Our friendly locals will welcome you into their homes as hotel space is limited and filled with character.</p>
