    <p>Year-round travel is possible to Hollandstoun Island, with creativity. In the summer our ferry from the Scottish mainland (6 hours) departs thrice weekly on a set schedule; fares can be booked in advance. Our winter ferry is provided by Mr Willingsworth (555-7734) on an as-needed basis; fares must be negotiated individually.</p>
    <p>He has been known to accept whisky as payment.</p>
